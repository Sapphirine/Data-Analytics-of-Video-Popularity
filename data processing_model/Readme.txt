process.py
read_data(): Read channel and video data from JSON files
clean_data(V): Clean video data (10 videos without stat and snippet are discarded)
video_sum(V): Get info of videos, Get mapping from channel to video
channel_sum(Cdata, VC_dict): get info of sampled channels
Clustering(C, K): Apply KMeans clustering on channel data and return statistics of clustering result
PCA(C_stat, C): Get the PCA representation of quantitation of channel popularity
Cgen(C, C_stat, C_des, C_title, C_pubtime, V_stat, V_comm, VC_dict):
	Generate part of channel features including (as matrix mat):
		Duration, video publishing frequency
		Ratio of subscriber/view, comment/view
		Sentiment anaylysis result: positive/negative/neutral/compound sentiment scores
	Generate response vector y according to clustering result:
		cluster1: [0, 850000000], cluster2:[850000000, 3700000000], cluster3[3700000000, infinity]
Vgen(V_stat, VC_dict):
	Aggregate the video statistics for each channel including:
		Ratio of like/dislike, comment/view, favorite/view
cat_dummy(VC_dict, V_catId, V_stat):
	Process and aggregate the category info of videos of a channel as dummy variable (44 categorys, 43 dummy variables)
ref_scores():
	Compute the referrer scores for each channel: sum(sum of each video's referrer's followers/1000.0)
socialmedia(C): Identify if channel has twitter, facebook, instagram google+
C_names(VC_dict, V_des, V_title):
	Named Entity Recognition: average occurrence of named entities in description and titles for each video of each channel
Agg1(mat, V_agg, C_name, Ref_scores, cat_id_dummy, social, y, C):
	Aggregate all the features: 
		C_name is score of named entity recognition
		cat_id_dummy are ecoded dummy features of video categories
		Ref_scores are aggregated referrer scores
		Social media scores
PROCESSER(): Aggregate all the processors

Train1(X, y): Train single Random Forest Classifier
cascadedRF_train(X, y, N): 
	Train a cascaded Random Forest classifier
	In each level discard class 1 1data which is classified correctly
cascadedRF_predict(data, models):
	Use cascaded Random Forest classifier to predict
test(model, testdata, testy): Test single Random Forest
test_cascaded(models, testdata, testy): Test cascaded Random Forest
Train_Kfold(X, y, K): K-Fold cross validation of model
feature_rank(model): Get the rank of features' relative importance given by Random Forest model
